# Style

Some authors to look at for style (from a Quora answer):
> In addition to Bernard Williams and Anthony Kenny, excellent suggestions already made, I would cite Bertrand Russell, and more particularly Willard Van Orman Quine, whose works on modern logic are models of clarity and pith.
> 
> I also find Galen Strawson and Thomas Nagel to be remarkably lucid, clear stylists.
> 
> In the nineteenth century, I think Schopenhauer writes like an angel — and he is always juggling and criticizing Kant’s (and others’) vast and intricate bodies of thought.
> 
> I should also mention Charles Taylor, who has done much to shed light on Continental philosophy for Anglophone readers.

Also, perhaps, perhaps Percy "The Bysshe" Bysshe.
