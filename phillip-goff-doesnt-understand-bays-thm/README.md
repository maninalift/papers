# Summary
This paper is a response to Phillip Goff's argument that the fine tuning argument cannot be used as an argument for the existence of multiple universes. This paper is not concerned with the validity of the premise that the universe if "fine tuned" for life but only the Baysian arguments as to whether this can be used as an argument for multiple universes.
